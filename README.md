# Notes

A minamlist command-line interface for note taking and organization, journaling, and task-tracking/managment written in ruby inspired by (and emulative of) Max Hodak's note-taking [system](https://github.com/maxhodak/notes) written in python. 

### Installation
1. Clone repo
2. Export `$NOTESPATH` (where you want your notes to be saved) and `$NOTESCRIPT` (where you cloned this repo) from your profile. Something like this: 

    ```
    export NOTESPATH="/path/to/home/documents/notes"
    export NOTESCRIPT="/path/to/where/you/cloned/repo/notes"
    ```
    
3. `cd` into repo and run the following commands:

    ```
    make install
    bundle install
    ```
